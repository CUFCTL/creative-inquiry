## Welcome

Welcome to the FCTL creative inquiry site! This website is a repository of resources for undergraduates who want to get involved with research in our lab. In particular, our lab does research in __computer architecture__, __high-performance computing__, and __machine learning__.

### Course Information

Our creative inquiry meets twice a week (times to be announced). More information below:

- [2018 Fall](course-info/2018-fall.md)
- [2018 Spring](course-info/2018-spring.md)
- [2017 Fall](course-info/2017-fall.md)

### Skills Overview

Doing research in our lab requires a wide variety of skills. These days you can learn just about anything from the Internet, but here we provide a condensed set of pages that will introduce you to the skills you will need.

1. [Linux](skills/linux.md)
2. [Palmetto Cluster](skills/palmetto-cluster.md)
3. [Git](skills/git.md)
4. [Python](skills/python.md)
5. [Machine Learning](skills/machine-learning.md)
6. [Datasets](skills/datasets.md)
7. [High-performance computing](skills/hpc.md)
8. [LaTeX](skills/latex.md)

### Jupyter Notebooks

Our primary mode of teaching is through Jupyter notebooks. Here are all of the notebooks we have so far:

- [Introduction](assets/notebooks/introduction.ipynb)
- [Working with Data](assets/notebooks/data-visualization.ipynb)
- [Supervised Learning](assets/notebooks/supervised-learning.ipynb)
- [Unsupervised Learning](assets/notebooks/unsupervised-learning.ipynb)
- [Neural Networks: Linear Layers](assets/notebooks/neural-networks-linear.ipynb)

### Projects

We have a number of ongoing research projects that undergraduates can get involved in. More information to come!

- [Face recognition](face-recognition/)
- [Object detection](object-detection/)
- Genomic data
