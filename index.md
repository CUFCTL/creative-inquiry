## Welcome

Welcome to the FCTL creative inquiry site! This website is a repository of resources for undergraduates who want to get involved with research in our lab. In particular, our lab does research in __computer architecture__, __high-performance computing__, and __machine learning__.

### Skills Overview

Doing research in our lab requires a wide variety of skills. These days you can learn just about anything from the Internet, but here we provide a condensed set of pages that will introduce you to the skills you will need.

1. [Git Basics](skills/git-basics.md)
2. [Palmetto Cluster](skills/palmetto-cluster.md)
3. [Python Tools](skills/python-tools.md)
4. [Jupyter Notebooks](skills/jupyter-notebooks.md)
5. [Machine Learning Basics](skills/machine-learning-basics.md)
6. [LaTeX](skills/latex.md)

### Projects

We have a number of ongoing research projects that undergraduates can get involved in. More information to come!

- [Face recognition](face-recognition/)
- Object detection
- Genomic data

### External Resources
