## Welcome

Welcome to the FCTL creative inquiry site! This website is a repository of resources for undergraduates who want to get involved with research in our lab. In particular, our lab does research in __computer architecture__, __high-performance computing__, and __machine learning__.

### Course Information

Our creative inquiry meets twice a week (times to be announced). More information below:
