    "\n",
    "In the \"Working with Data\" notebook we emphasized the importance of understanding your data. The next step in designing a machine learning system is to __understand your task__. That is, what are you trying to accomplish with youe system? Do you have reason to believe that it can be done by a machine? In theory, if a human can perform some task, a machine can probably perform that task too. This statement comes with many caveats and considerations which we will continue to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will study a class of tasks called __supervised learning__. In supervised learning, the task is to predict an output given an input; in mathematical terms, any supervised learning algorithm simply tries to learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(\\vec{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\vec{x}$ is the input, $y$ is the output, and $f(\\vec{x})$ is the underlying relationship that we are trying to learn. We have already seen an example of such an input / output pair: the Iris dataset. In that dataset, the four features form the input and the species label is the output. We can then imagine a system that predicts the species of a flower based on it's four features, and in fact that's the first thing we'll do in this notebook. This particular task is called __classification__, because the output is a categorical or discrete variable; the other task we'll study is __regression__, in which the output is a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we used the entire dataset; in general, however, we may not always do that. A dataset can have more than one type of label, or a lot of features that might not all be relevant. When selecting a dataset to perform a task, we also select which features and label(s) to use based on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: some code segments have TODO comments in them. These comments are optional exercises for you to modify the code in a useful way, however they are not meant to be restrictive. Feel free to modify the code in this notebook any way you like; it's a great way to practice your coding skills._\n",

    "Now we need something that can perform the classification task... we need a machine learning algorithm! Specifically, we need a __classifier__. Let's go back to our mathematical formulation, but with one added detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(\\vec{x}; \\vec{\\theta})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we say that $f(\\vec{x}; \\vec{\\theta})$ is our __model__, and $\\vec{\\theta}$ is the set of __parameters__ which define our model. This form is one of the most basic ways to describe pretty much any supervised learning algorithm. The important thing to understand is that $\\theta$ can be __literally anything__; we can have as many parameters as we want, and we can arrange them into whatever mathematical expression we want. The learning algorithm (in this case, the classifier) that we choose will determine the structure of these parameters and how they are fitted to best perform the task. We won't explore the mathematical structure of every learning algorithm in these notebooks; for those details we refer you to several well-known resources which can be found on the course website. We only provide this basic formulation to aid your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the learning algorithm that we choose will give us a model and a way to fit it to our task. There's one more thing: we need a way to __evaluate our model__. To do this, we'll split our dataset into two parts: a __training set__ which will be used to fit the model, and a __testing set__ which will be used to evaluate the model at the end. This procedure is pretty much the same regardless of what learning algorithm we use so let's go ahead and get it out of the way:"

    "\n",
    "1. __Training Phase__ : In this phase we show our machine learning model data (one at a time) and a corresponding __label__ and continue to do so until we've exhausted our _training set_. For example, if we were looking for cats in a picture we would show \n",
    "our model pictures of different types of cats and tell it that this is a cat. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Prediction Phase__: Once we have shown our model enough samples, we now simply ask it to classify an unseen data point into a distinct bin from our _test set_. From our analogy of the cat example, once we've trained our model on cats we can then show our model a picture of say a Bengal \n",
    "cat and if that is classified as a cat we say that our model has trained well. Otherwise we may need to go back to phase 1 all over again with more samples. \n",

Here's how it works: save all of the training samples and their labels, and then when performing classification, label a test sample according to the labels of it's $k$ nearest neighbors in the training set. There are two choices we have to make with this algorithm in order to use it:\n",

    "\n",
    "Is 96% good enough? Once again, that depends entirely on your task, or what you are trying to accomplish. For example, 96% is usually good enough to get the best grade in a class, most people would probably not trust a surgeon who performs well 96% of the time, or an airplane pilot who flies correctly 96% of the time. Furthermore, accuracy is only one example of an __evaluation metric__; there are many other metrics, and although accuracy is one of the easiest to understand intuitively, it is not always the best way to evaluate a model's performance. Later on we will explore some other metrics.\n",
