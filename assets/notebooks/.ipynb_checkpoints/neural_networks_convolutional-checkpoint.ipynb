    "There has been a lot of buzz surrounding the area of autonomous driving and GANs. Modern deep learning has almost become synonyms with the output of a particular class of neural networks. In this notebook, we meet these beasts and call them \"Convolutional Neural Networks\". We shall explore what convolution is, what does a convolutional layer do and then build our very first classifier. "

    "In order to understand convolutional neural networks, we need to understand what a convolution operation does. Now, If I went a \"convolution is an operation that computes the average of everything in a fixed window\" you'll probably groan internally. I'm gonna be better and show you visually how a convolution looks like for an image. "
