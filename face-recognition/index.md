## Face Recognition

This is the main page for the face recognition project. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for real-time face recognition. We created a C++ library, mlearn, which provides several machine learning algorithms, and we created a real-time recognition system which uses OpenCV and mlearn.
