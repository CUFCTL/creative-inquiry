## Machine Learning

Machine learning is the study of _learning algorithms_ that can _learn_ from and make _predictions_ on _data_. It is a sub-field of computer science, and it lies at the intersection of several fields including pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. The family of machine learning algorithms is quite diverse, but there are a few categories that are used to keep track of all of them:

Supervised learning
- Regression
- Classification

Unsupervised learning
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
