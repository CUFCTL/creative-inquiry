## LaTeX

LaTeX is a tool for creating nicely formatted documents. Lots of math teachers use it for worksheets and tests, lots of conferences and journals use it for research papers. The easiest way to use LaTeX is through [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/), which provides a WYSIWYG interface and documentation on how to use LaTeX.
