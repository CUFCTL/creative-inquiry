## Datasets

Before you can do any sort of machine learning task, you need data. Fortunately there are a great variety of datasets out there for all sorts of things.

Here are some links:
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

- [CIFAR 100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

- [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

- [Caltech 101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101)

## Face Recognition Datasets:
A lot of theses datasets are highly complex. If you're planning to to a face-rec based project consult the TAs.
