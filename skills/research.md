## Research

Research is often seen as doing a lot of work that amounts to not a lot of useful results -- graduate students working long hours every day, constantly trying to publish papers that nobody will read, and so on. When put this way, research doesn't sound very enticing. But research, whether in academia or industry, is not about experiments and publications alone. It is about __answering hard questions and solving hard problems__. You've probably done research many times without actually calling it "research". Even if it wasn't something novel, like learning how to solve homework problems for a course, it was novel for you. Those problem solving skills that you gain from taking courses are equally necessary when doing research.

Research is essentially the application of the scientific method, and the key to doing good research is essentially to stick to the scientific method -- identify a research question, create a hypothesis, test your hypothesis with experiments, and so on. But there is more to say about how to continually do good research, as part of a career for example. So we'll list some of the key stages in research and give some practical advice on how to do each stage well:

- __Literature review__

- __Implementation__

- __Experimentation__

- __Publication__
