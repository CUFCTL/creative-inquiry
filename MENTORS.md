# Mentor's Guide

This document is a guide for new mentors on how to run the ML/BD Creative Inquiry.

## Mentor Requirements

The ML/BD CI is a creative inquiry that trains undergraduate students in a variety of skills spanning machine learning, data science, and high-performance computing. Students learn through a series of Jupyter notebooks and then through a personal or team-based project, for which they write a report at the end of the semester. As a CI mentor it is helpful but not necessary that you have experience in all three of these disciplines, so that you are best able to guide students through the notebook content and the hurdles they encounter in their projects. Fortunately, most of the course is encoded in the Jupyter notebooks and skills pages on the CI website, so it is only essential that you as a mentor know how to point students in the right direction, to help them when you know the answer and point them to the right resources when you don't. You also at least need to know your way around Palmetto and JupyterHub so that you can help students set up their programming environment.

__Hard Requirements__
- Awareness of all resources available on the CI website
- Proficiency with Palmetto, JupyterHub, Anaconda, Jupyter notebooks
- Ability to explain technical concepts and work through problems with students
- Ability to help students select a focused project from many options

__Soft Requirements__
- Proficiency with Python (keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow)
- Proficiency with data science concepts (datasets, data visualization)
- Proficiency with machine learning concepts (supervised learning, unsupervised learning)
- Proficiency with neural networks (MLPs, CNNs, autoencoders)
- Proficiency with GPU computing (CUDA)

In other words, think of yourself not as a teacher but as a _facilitator_. It is the students' responsibility to educate themselves and discover what interests them the most, but it is your job to help them get started on the journey and offer advice when they need it.

## Overview of CI Resources

### Box Folder

The CI Box folder is located [here](https://clemson.app.box.com/folder/11145145746). It contains a lot of old documents that may or may not be of use, but the main things we put in there are (1) semester reports from CI students, (2) honors theses for CI students who do departmental honors with us, and (3) datasets used by former students that we want to keep around for future students. Feel free to use the Box folder for whatever you want but make sure to add the semester reports and honors theses at the end of each semester.

### Website

The CI website is located [here](https://cufctl.github.io/creative-inquiry/). The website has four main sections:

- __Course Information__: instructions on how to register for the course, weekly course schedule, contact information for Dr. Smith and mentors
- __Skills Overview__: list of pages that introduce a variety of skills used in the CI, including the "getting started" instructions
- __Jupyter Notebooks__: list of the Jupyter notebooks used in the course, instructions on how to run them on Palmetto or Google Colab
- __Project Gallery__: list of projects by former students, formatted as Jupyter notebooks, that new students can be inspired by or pick up and improve

### Physical Resources

The CI doesn't really need any physical equipment, since every student does all of their work from their laptop. Of course there is the lab where we have our weekly meetings. We have a big conference table, plenty of chairs, and a giant flatscreen TV. Great for presentations!
