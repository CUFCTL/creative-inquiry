## Week 1: Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing field of research in our lab and around the world. We will introduce you to all the hot buzzwords (AI, machine learning, deep learning, data science, etc.) and to some of the work that we have done in our lab. We will give you an overview of what to expect from this creative inquiry in the coming semester.

### Deliverable

Get access to Palmetto. Refer to [Palmetto Cluster](../skills/palmetto-cluster.md) for details.

## Week 2: Command-line Tools

In order to do anything with machine learning you have to learn the tools, and not just how to use the Linux command-line, but how to use the Linux command-line in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. We will show you how to get started with Clemson's HPC cluster, Palmetto. We will also show you how to use Jupyter notebooks, which are sort of like interactive Python worksheets, on Palmetto, without even using the command-line (hopefully)! We will do all of our work from this point with Jupyter notebooks.

### Deliverable

Create a Jupyter notebook on Palmetto JupyterHub and run this code:
```
import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import sklearn
```

Not all of these packages are installed by default on Palmetto, so you will have to create a custom Anaconda environment and install those packages, and then make your environment accessible on JupyterHub. Refer to [Jupyter Notebooks](../skills/jupyter-notebooks.md) for details.

## Week 3: Working with Data

The first and most important step when designing a machine learning system: _understand your data_. We will show you how to load, manipulate, and visualize data in Python. No more Excel worksheets like what they make you do in general engineering, we're going to do it in code. We will use several popular Python packages: __pandas__ for loading data, and __matplotlib__ and __seaborn__ for visualization.

## Week 4: Supervised Learning

Now that we know how to look at data in Python, let's use machine learning to understand it. We will look at a class of machine learning called _supervised learning_. In supervised learning, the model learns a task from labeled examples. One example is predicting the price of a house based on the house's age, area, location, etc; this kind of task is called _regression_. Another example is predicting whether a tumor is cancerous based on size, location, age of the patient, etc; this kind of task is called _classification_. We will learn how to train machine learning models to perform regression and classification in Python. We will use a Python package called __scikit-learn__.

## Week 5: Unsupervised Learning

Another class of machine learning is _unsupervised learning_. In unsupervised learning, the model learns a task from unlabelled examples, usually to find some kind of structure in the data. The most common type of unsupervised task is _clustering_, such as finding communities of people in a social network or communities of genes in a gene interaction network. Another common task is _dimensionality reduction_, which is used to visualize high-dimensional data by transforming the data into 2D or 3D while preserving it's structure. We will look at clustering and dimensionality reduction in Python using __scikit-learn__.
