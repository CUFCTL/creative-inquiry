## Week 1: Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing field of research in our lab and around the world. We will introduce you to all the hot buzzwords (AI, machine learning, deep learning, data science, etc.) and to some of the work that we have done in our lab. We will give you an overview of what to expect from this creative inquiry in the coming semester.

## Week 2: Command-line Tools

In order to do anything with machine learning you have to learn the tools, and not just how to use the Linux command-line, but how to use the Linux command-line in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. We will show you how to get started with Clemson's HPC cluster, Palmetto. We will also show you how to use Jupyter notebooks, which are sort of like interactive Python worksheets, on Palmetto, without even using the command-line (hopefully)! We will do all of our work from this point with Jupyter notebooks.

## Week 3: Working with Data

The first and most important step when designing a machine learning system: _understand your data_. We will show you how to load, manipulate, and visualize data in Python. No more Excel worksheets like what they make you do in general engineering, we're going to do it in code.
